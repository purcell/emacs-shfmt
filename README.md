shfmt.el
==============

This Emacs library provides commands and a minor mode for easily reformatting
shell script source code using the [shfmt][shfmt] program.

Installation
=============

If you choose not to use one of the convenient
packages in [MELPA][melpa], you'll need to
add the directory containing `shfmt.el` to your `load-path`, and
then `(require 'shfmt)`.

Usage
=====

Customise the `shfmt-command` variable as desired, then call
`shfmt-buffer` or `shfmt-region` as convenient.

Enable `shfmt-on-save-mode` in Shell Mode buffers like this:

```el
(add-hook 'sh-mode-hook 'shfmt-on-save-mode)
```

or locally to your project with a form in your .dir-locals.el like
this:

```el
((sh-mode
   (mode . shfmt-on-save)))
```

You might like to bind `shfmt` or `shfmt-buffer` to a key,
e.g. with:

```el
(define-key 'sh-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-f") 'shfmt)
```

Use-package
==========

Alternatively, here is how you can install and configure `shfmt` via use-package

```el
(use-package shfmt
  :hook
  (sh-mode . shfmt-on-save-mode)
  :custom
  (shfmt-arguments '("-i" "4" "-ci" "-d")))
```
